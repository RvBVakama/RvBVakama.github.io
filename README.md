## Mitchell Cattini-Schultz



### Welcome to my portfolio website.

My name is Mitchell, I live in Melbourne and am currently studing at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE). I have 1.5 years in C++ and over 3 years of Unity C# experience. I have also worked with HTML and CSS in the past and believe it would be simple to pick it back up if needed.

Below you can browse a few projects that I have developed during my time at AIE.



### Backyard Snowdown

[Backyard Snowdown](https://github.com/hamishsmithers/FrankenfruitStudioEOYProject) was produced by team "Frankenfruit Studio". This game was the product of my 2017 end-of-year team game assignment. Frankenfruit Studio consisted of 2 designers, 2 programmers, and 3 artists.
We created a kids imagination of a backyard winter snow fight! Fast-paced, snowball throwing, intense moments inducing local multiplayer game!
The last kid standing wins.
