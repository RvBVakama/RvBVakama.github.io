## Mitchell Cattini-Schultz



### Welcome to my portfolio website.

My name is Mitchell, I live in Melbourne and am currently studing at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE). I have 1.5 years in C++ and over 3 years of Unity C# experience. I have also worked with HTML and CSS in the past and believe it would be easy to pick it back up if needed.

Below you can browse a few projects that I have developed during my time at AIE.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RvBVakama/RvBVakama.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
