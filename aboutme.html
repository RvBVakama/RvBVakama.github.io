          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <br/>
          <p>
          Hey I'm Mitchell, a student at the "Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE)".
          <br/> 
          I'm in my second year studying games programming in the "Bachelor of Games and Virtual Worlds" course.
          <br/>
          This is currently my fifth year in studying games. I have already completed three years of 3D education and 4 years of programming.
          <br/>
          <br/>      
          <h3> My Goal </h3>    
          My current goal in life is to live and work in Japan as a games programmer of some sort. <br/>
          To be able to work, earn a living, travel around the country and experience life as a japanese resident.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>   
          <h3> Skills </h3>   
          I am looking to enter the industry to utilize my current programming skillset:
          <dl>
            <dd>C++</dd>
            <dd>C#</dd>
            <dd>Unity3D</dd>
            <dd>WinForms</dd>
            <dd>C</dd>
          </dl>
          <br/>
          I am also interested in the following and want to improve my ability of them further:
            <br/>
          <dl>
            <dd>HTML, I have been writing up this site for the past few days</dd>
            <dd>CSS, same as above</dd>
            <dd>Python</dd>
            <dd>Unreal Engine</dd>
            <dd>Custom C++ Engines</dd>
            <dd>Linux Command Line</dd>
          </dl>
            <br/>
            <br/>
          <h3>When I'm Not Programming</h3>
          When I'm not programming I'm usually enjoying games on my phone such as Hearthstone (which impresses me each time I play it and in which I find to be really interesting, because it is created and maintained in Unity3D). I also like to research as much as I can about Japan and its culture and the various interesting geographical locations it has to offer.
