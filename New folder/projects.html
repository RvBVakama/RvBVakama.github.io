							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<br />
							<p>
								Hey I'm Mitchell, and I'm currently studying at the "Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE)".
								<br />
								I'm in my second year studying games programming in the "Bachelor of Games and Virtual Worlds" course.
								<br />
								This is my fifth year in studying games. I have already completed three years of 3D education and four years of programming.
								<br />
								<br />
								<h3> My Goal </h3>
								My current goal in life is to live and work in Japan as a games programmer. <br />
								To be able to work, earn a living, travel around the country and experience life as a japanese resident.
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								<h3> Skills </h3>
								I am looking to enter the industry to utilize my current programming skillset:
								<dl>
									<dd>C++</dd>
									<dd>C#</dd>
									<dd>Unity3D</dd>
									<dd>WinForms</dd>
									<dd>C</dd>
								</dl>
								<br />
								I am also interested in the following fields and want to improve my ability in them further:
								<br />
								<dl>
									<dd>HTML, I have been writing up this site for the past few days</dd>
									<dd>CSS, same as above</dd>
									<dd>Python</dd>
									<dd>Unreal Engine</dd>
									<dd>Custom C++ Engines</dd>
									<dd>Linux Command Line</dd>
								</dl>
								<br />
								<br />
								<h3>When I'm Not Programming</h3>
								When I'm not programming I usually enjoy playing games on my phone and computer such as Hearthstone (Unity3D game, this impresses me everytime I play). I also like to research as much as I can about Japan and its culture and the various interesting geographical locations it has to offer aswell as the idea of living and working there.

			<h3 href="https://github.com/hamishsmithers/FrankenfruitStudioEOYProject">Backyard Snowdown</h3>
			<p>
				Backyard Snowdown was produced by "Frankenfruit Studio". Our game was the product of my 2017 end of year team game assignment. Frankenfruit Studio consisted of 2 designers, 2 programmers, and 3 artists.
				We created a kid's imagination of a backyard winter snow fight! A fast-paced local multiplayer party game!
				<br>
				The last kid standing wins.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Development Process</h3>
			<p>
				Backyard Snowdown's development spanned over 2 months. Early on, both our designers were absent for around 4 weeks, due to this, our other programmer and I took it upon ourselves to design the game. We ended up having a really great response from the teachers and other students, this taught us to be flexible and innovative when it came to thinking on our feet. As a part of the assessment our teachers organized an industry panel whos jobs were to come in and provide feedback on the various games. What surpised us was when it came our turn to present, during the question period they had no advice for us (every other group had advice given). This gave our team a huge boost in morale because it showed us that we had been developing the game to a great standard.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h3>What I contributed</h3>
			<br />
			<dl>
				<dt>Jumping Snowman</dt>
				<dd>I created the jumping snowman that appears and starts jumping around dealing a knock-back effect to players. I learned a lot about Unity's math functions such as Vector3.Lerp and Physics.CheckSphere.</dd>
				<br />
				<dt>Dash</dt>
				<dd>I programmed the dash feature. Dash allows the players to dive towards players or snowballs, which allows players to pickup snowballs or steal them from other players and to also catch them mid-flight. This really adds an interesting and fun element of gameplay to the game as it allows players to have more of a chance aginst other players.</dd>
				<br />
				<dt>Object Pool</dt>
				<dd>I learned how to create a object pool during the development of the game. Object pools allow for more efficient management of game assets/resources. It also eliminates the possibility of an object existing more times than is allowed by the object pool.</dd>
			</dl>
			<br />
			<dt>Player Logic</dt>
			<dd>The player went through many stages of development, the player script was very complex and taught us a lot about specific Unity features, such as layers, collision detection, Fixed Update, code neatness, code commenting standards and complex systems such as the snowball charging and firing systems.</dd>
			</dl>
			<br />
			<dt>Snowball</dt>
			<dd>The snowball is the element of the game that players use to damage other players and ultimately is the way the winner is decided. This script is also quite complex, it tracks various variables such as velocity and collision targets to provide a balanced way for it function.</dd>

			<h3>Six Million Dollar Vigilante Reloaded</h3>
			<p>Six Million Dollar Vigilante Reloaded was created during a game jam at AIE. This was a three day game jam.</p>
			<p>The game is about a robot in the olden western times shooting bad guys and reaching the boss and to defeat him.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>What I contributed</h3>
			<br />
			<dl>
				<dt>Object Pool</dt>
				<dd>This is used to pool the bullet prefab so we can instantiate 6 bullets at the start of the game and then just reuse them during the game. Setting the bullets to false when they are reloaded and activating them when the player shoots.</dd>
				<br />
				<dt>Round Manager</dt>
				<dd>I spent alot of time on this part of the project making it really easy for the designers to set up. It works based on if all the enemies in the current room are all dead or not, when it detects this it moves to the next room. The system is modular, you just have to use the folder structure provided. When the game starts, my code runs and automatically detects how many enemies are in each room and also how many rooms there are. This information is stored in a list of lists. The main benefit in using this that the traditional way requires designers to drag and drop the enemies onto a publicly exposed list variable. This way saves that effort because it detects the enemies and adds them via code.</dd>
				<br />
				<dt>Fly Camera</dt>
				<dd>This works in unison with the round manager, when the fly camera script gets the information from the round manager, that all the enemies in the room have died, it triggers to fly to the next room. It does this by lerping between empty game objects in the scene and by Transform.LookAt() lerping. There is a list of "Camera Location Points" and a list of "Camera LookAt Points" these list and self-explanatory and tell the camera where to go and to where to look in correlation with the specific round.</dd>
