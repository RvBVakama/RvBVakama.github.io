				<h1>Escape This Map Tool: C# / Winforms</h1>
				<p>
					I created this C# tool as a part of my custom C# tool project nearing the end of my 2017 year at AIE. It features loading, saving, drag and drop loading, undo and redo capabilities. The aim of this application was to assist in the quick creation of map files for a friends steam game. His map files were serialized in normal text format, he also had no other way for his players to create maps other than just typing in a new txt file, which was quite tedious.
				</p>
				<h3>What I learned</h3>
				<p>
					Before this project I had not properly created a winforms application. It was a totally cool and interesting way to go about coding. Events! and no update function. Quickly I figured out how to code using this new style of structuring code. I had also never coded programmed undo and redo capabilites in any of my previous projects, so learning how to program this properly was really interesting to me.

				<h1>Unity Physics Scene</h1>
				<br />
				<p>
					For this assignment at AIE we had to demonstrate our knowledge of how to use Unity's physics functionality to create realistic player interaction with dynamic appropriately weighted objects.
					<br />
					Another major part of the assignment was that we could create a very capable player controller.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					<h3>My controller features:</h3>
					<br />
					<dl>
						<dt>Ability to walk up and down stairs</dt>
						<dd>This uses raycasts and checks for objects around that player that are higher than its current feet location approximation.</dd>
						<br />
						<dt>Crouching and crouch detection</dt>
						<dd>Player will crouch whilst Ctrl is held, but if you are under something it will not clip into that object on letting go of ctrl, instead it will stay crouched. When it can stand, it will.</dd>
						<br />
						<dt>Ability to walk up and down slopes</dt>
						<dd>This is pretty similar to the stairs, but it was a tad trickier to get working well.</dd>
