<p>
	My name is Mitchell, I live in Melbourne and am currently studing at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE). 
	<br/>
	I have 1.5 years in C++ and over 3 years of Unity C# experience. 
	I have also worked with HTML and CSS in the past and believe it would be simple to pick it back up if needed.

	Below you can browse a few projects that I have developed during my time at AIE.
