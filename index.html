        <a href="https://github.com/hamishsmithers/FrankenfruitStudioEOYProject">Backyard Snowdown</a>
        <p1>
            was produced by team "Frankenfruit Studio". This game was the product of my 2017 end-of-year team game assignment. Frankenfruit Studio consisted of 2 designers, 2 programmers, and 3 artists.
            We created a kids imagination of a backyard winter snow fight! Fast-paced, snowball throwing, intense moments inducing local multiplayer game!
            <br />
            The last kid standing wins.
