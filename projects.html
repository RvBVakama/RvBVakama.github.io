          <h3 href="https://github.com/hamishsmithers/FrankenfruitStudioEOYProject">Backyard Snowdown</h3>
          <p>
            Backyard Snowdown was produced by "Frankenfruit Studio". This game was the product of my 2017 end-of-year team game assignment. Frankenfruit Studio consisted of 2 designers, 2 programmers, and 3 artists.
            We created a kids imagination of a backyard winter snow fight! Fast-paced, snowball throwing, intense moments inducing local multiplayer game!
            <br>
            The last kid standing wins.
          </p>
          <h3>The Development Process</h3>
          <p>
            Backyard Snowdown's development spanned over 2 months. Early on both our designers were absent for around 4 weeks, due to this myself and the other programmer on the project took it upon our selfs to design the game. The we had a really great response from the teachers and other students, this taught us to be flexible and innovative. As a part of the assesment, our teachers organized an industry panel that were to come in and provide feedback. What surpised us was when it came our turn to present and then the question period, they had no advice for us (every other group had advice given). This gave our team a huge boost in morale because it showed us that we had been developing the game to a great standard.

          <br/>
          <dl>
            <dt>Jumping Snowman</dt>
            <dd>I created the jumping snowman that appears after a a set time during a match. I learned alot about Unity math functions such as Vector3.Lerp and Physics.CheckSphere.</dd>
          <br/>
            <dt>Dash</dt>
            <dd>I programmed the dash feature. Dash allows the players to dash, which in turn allows players to pickup snowballs, steal them from other players and catch them mid-flight. This really adds a fun element of gameplay to the game as it allows players to have more of a chance aginst other players currently charging up a shot to fire at them.</dd>
          <br/>
            <dt>Object Pool</dt>
            <dd>I learned how to create a object pool during the game's development. Object pools allow for more efficient manegment of game assets/resources. It also gets rid of the possibility of an object existing more times than is allowed by the object pool.</dd>
          </dl>
          <br/>
            <dt>Player Logic</dt>
            <dd>The player went through many stages of development, the player class script was very complex and taught me alot about specific Unity features, such as layers, collision detection, Fixed Update, code neatness, code commenting standards and complex systems such as the snowball charging and firing system.</dd>
          </dl>
          <br/>
            <dt>Snowball</dt>
            <dd>The snowball is the element of the game that players use to damage other players and ultimately is the way the winner is decided. This script is also quite complex, it tracks various variables such as velocity and collision targets to provide a balanced way for it to act.</dd>

          <h3>Six Million Dollar Vigilante Reloaded</h3>
          <p>Six Million Dollar Vigilante Reloaded was created during a game jam at AIE. This was a three day game jam.</p>
          <p>The game is about a robot in the olden western times shooting bad guys and reaching the boss and to defeat him</p>
          <br/>
          <h3>What I contributed</h3>
          <br/>
          <dl>
            <dt>Object Pool</dt>
            <dd>This is used to pool the bullet prefab so we can instantiate 6 bullets at the start of the game and then just reuse them during the game, setting them to false when they are reloaded and activating them when we shoot</dd>
          <br/>
            <dt>Round Manager</dt>
            <dd>I spent alot of time on this part of the project making it really easy for the designers to set up which enemies are in which room and when they all die it moves to the next room. The system is modular, you just have to use the folder structure provided. When the game starts my code runs and automatically detects how many enemies are in each room and also how many rooms there are. This information is stored in a list of lists. The main benfit to this is that the traditional way requires designers to drag and drop the enemies onto a publicly exposed list variable, this way saves that effort because it detects the enemies and adds them via code.</dd>
          <br/>
            <dt>Fly Camera</dt>
            <dd>This works in unison with the round manager, when the fly camera script gets the information from the round manager that all the enemies in the room have died it triggers to fly to the next room. It does this by lerping between empty game objects in the scene and by Transform.LookAt() lerping. There is a list of "Camera Location Points" and a list of "Camera LookAt Points" these list and self-explanatory and tell the camera where to go and to where to look in correlation with the specific round.</dd>
